    "The NFL has a vast amount of data on teams, games, and players, and it is all freely available on their website. The problem is, this is not a usable format for data scientists to work with. If you Google \"NFL database\" you are limited to websites that let you search for specific statistics, or paid full datasets. NFL data is big business. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a good article that is essentially the problem definition here: https://codeandfootball.wordpress.com/2011/02/15/so-where-can-i-find-free-nfl-data-sets/\n",
    "\n",
    "And it appears that since that was written in 2011, there still hasn't been much headway in addressing the problem. So this project aims to fill that void in a modest, yet useful way. Screen-scraping is still at the core of the solution, which is really the core of the problem as well. If the data were readily available in any other format, this would be a piece of cake. But unfortunately, preprocessing the data is about 75% of the work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) There are a finite and manageable number of teams (32, currently), so putting these in by hand was trivial.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) The NFL website makes it rather easy for automated screen scraping, particularly for player data. The URIs have the following format: www.nfl.com/player/{full_player_name}/{nfl_player_id}/profile?season={season_year}. One caveat to this though, is that if a player stopped playing in previous years, each year after that will list his last year's stats, whereas if you select a year before they were in the NFL, it simply says there are no stats available. A nice gotcha.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.) NFL Player IDs are available wherever there is a link to the player. A good starting point is the Stats by Position page: http://www.nfl.com/players/search?category=position. I only went with current players, but for future expansion, we could look at historical players too. \n",
    "\n",
    "4.) Games are available dating back to 1970 on the Schedules page: http://www.nfl.com/schedules\n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part, this is a pretty straightforward exercise. Scrape the data, munge it into a TSV, pull the TSV into a database. There's always a catch or two. Real life isn't as structured as we would like it to be. Teams change cities. The L.A. Rams become the St. Louis Rams, the Houston Oilers become the Tennessee Oilers and then the Tennessee Titans, and the L.A. Raiders become (once again), the Oakland Raiders. Man, why can't Los Angeles keep a football team? \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, players can change position too. Take Terrelle Pryor. He is listed on the NFL website as a WR, yet, he saw most of his action as a QB with the Raiders. But instead of putting in the passing data along with his WR stats, they just list the WR stats. So strictly using the NFL website, that data is not available. ESPN actually does a better job and lists all stats (even defensive in case that weird situation were to arise). In hindsite, perhaps EPSN would have been a better source. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is meant to be a starting block. A jumping off point. I would like to build on this and create an all-encompassing NFL database, free for anyone to use. Additionally, this was an excuse for me to learn new technologies. So please excuse my Python, it's my first attempt. My code isn't normally this sloppy, but there was a lot of experimentation going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the munging is done in plain ol' Bash using a lot of sed and grep. I recently discovered that you can execute Bash scripts directly from Jupyter, but I haven't tried it. So instead, I just listed my scripts here. And, probably a no-no as far as these projects go, I didn't list the little one-liners I used, so that's going to make reproducing this a little harder. However, my goal is to completely automate this so I can schedule it to run each Monday morning after the games have played for the week and update the database so we can have up-to-the-week data for our analyses and applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as football is a sport, I think this will be a work in progress. Besides weekly updates during football season, future enhancements include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Offensive and Defensive linemen stats\n",
    "* Punter stats\n",
    "* Play-By-Play stats\n",
    "* Historical data (as far back as I can get it)\n",
    "* Some way to deal with team ownership/name/location history\n",
    "* Q/A and Validation of data using multiple sources (ESPN, Yahoo! Sports, etc.)\n",
    "* Fantasy points for non-ppr standard leagues and possibly PPR standard leagues\n",
    "\n",
